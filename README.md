## LineageOS for the Innioasis Y1
I am working on a port of LineageOS 10.x for the Innioasis Y1. With this, we could map the buttons to moving a cursor like gamepad arrows, and use it like a touchscreen device (sort of). This would allow it to run most android apps natively, and allow for things like Spotify, Youtube, and Apple Music.
